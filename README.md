My personal vagrant setup.  This way I can share.

It uses puppet.local, and a client.local box.

Client.local does *not* run puppet automatically.


NOTE: Repos directory (well, the directory it is symlinked too) has clones of the following:

10gen
centos
epel
puppet
jenkins
remi
percona
snap

Currently. You may need to edit the repo files inside files to match, as necessary.  Or inside your code.
